# Data-Science
This repo covers the data science projects I have worked on, starting from formulating research questions to drawing conclusions. For the purpose of illustrating my skills, I created folders for each of the main data science techniques:

1. Clustering - K-means
2. Classifying - decision tree and random forest
3. Dimension reduction - principle component analysis
